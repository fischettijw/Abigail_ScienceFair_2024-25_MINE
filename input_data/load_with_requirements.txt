Install the Modules:

Once you're in your project directory (and your virtual environment, if you're using one),
run the following command to install all the modules listed in requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will ensure that all the modules specified in your requirements.txt are installed
in your current Python environment, whether itâ€™s new or existing.


MAYBE:    pip3.12  or pip3.11
